Welcome to my homepage! 

I'm currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the [https://www.pacm.princeton.edu/ Program in Applied and Computational Mathematics (PACM)] at Princeton University, working with Professor [http://web.math.princeton.edu/~amits/ Amit Singer]. 
Previously, I obtained my Ph.D. in [https://statistics.yale.edu/ Statistics and Data Science] at Yale University, advised by Professors [http://www.stat.yale.edu/~zf59/ Zhou Fan] and [https://sahandnegahban.com/ Sahand Negahban]. I was also very fortunate to be supervised by Professors [https://sites.google.com/site/xiaohongchenyale/ Xiaohong Chen], [https://yisun.io/ Yi Sun], [https://roy.lederman.name/ Roy Lederman], [https://sites.stat.washington.edu/people/fanghan/ Fang Han] and [https://sites.google.com/view/bcaffo/home Brian Caffo] on particular projects.
Prior to joining Yale, I received my Bachelor's degree in mathematics and statistics from the [http://www.math.pku.edu.cn/ School of Mathematical Sciences] and a dual degree in Economics from the [http://www.nsd.pku.edu.cn/ China Center for Economic Research] at [http://english.pku.edu.cn/ Peking University].
